# Block Feature Audit

## Overview
This document summarizes the audit of the block feature in the application and the changes made to improve it.

## Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Database Relation Definition**: The `blockRelations` in the schema incorrectly defined a one-to-many relationship between a block and exercises, when it should be a one-to-one relationship.
2. **Missing Delete Functionality**: The admin interface had a delete button for blocks, but it didn't have any functionality implemented.
3. **No Confirmation for Destructive Actions**: There was no confirmation step before deleting a block, which could lead to accidental deletions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Database Relations
Updated the `blockRelations` definition in `db/schema.ts` to correctly reflect a one-to-one relationship between a block and an exercise:

```typescript
export const blockRelations = relations(block, ({one}) => ({
  exercise: one(exercises, {
    fields: [block.exerciseId],
    references: [exercises.id],
  })
}))
```

### 2. Added Delete Functionality
1. Created a new API endpoint at `app/api/admin/blocks/[id]/route.ts` to handle block deletion.
2. Implemented a `handleDeleteBlock` function in the admin interface to call the API endpoint.
3. Connected the delete button to the `handleDeleteBlock` function.

### 3. Added Confirmation Dialog
Added an AlertDialog component to the delete button to require confirmation before deleting a block, preventing accidental deletions.

## Future Improvements
While the current changes address the immediate issues with the block feature, there are additional improvements that could be made in the future:

1. Implement functionality for the "Add a day" button in the admin interface.
2. Implement functionality for the "Add an exercise" button in the admin interface.
3. Implement functionality for the "Save" button for day details in the admin interface.
4. Add error notifications to provide better feedback when operations fail.
5. Add success notifications to confirm when operations succeed.

## Conclusion
The block feature has been improved to fix the incorrect database relation definition and add delete functionality with confirmation. These changes enhance the data integrity and user experience of the application.
