# Redundancy and Fault-Resilience Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the changes made to implement redundancy and fault-resilience in the Renfo Pas Ã  Pas application.

## Files Created

1. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/redundancy.md`: Detailed documentation of the redundancy implementation
   - `docs/README-redundancy.md`: Quick start guide for the redundancy implementation
   - `docs/redundancy-summary.md`: This summary document

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `nginx/nginx.conf`: NGINX load balancer configuration
   - `db/postgresql.conf`: PostgreSQL primary server configuration
   - `db/postgresql.replica.conf`: PostgreSQL replica server configuration
   - `docker-compose.redundant.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for the redundant system

3. **Test Scripts**:
   - `scripts/test-redundancy.sh`: Bash script for testing the redundancy implementation
   - `scripts/test-redundancy.ps1`: PowerShell script for testing the redundancy implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Application Redundancy**:
   - Configured multiple application instances (3 replicas) in Docker Compose
   - Set up NGINX as a load balancer to distribute traffic across instances
   - Implemented shared storage for video files

2. **Database Redundancy**:
   - Configured a primary-replica setup for PostgreSQL
   - Set up the primary server for write operations
   - Set up the replica server for read operations and failover

3. **Storage Redundancy**:
   - Implemented a shared volume for video storage
   - Configured all application instances to use the shared storage

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added detailed documentation of the redundancy implementation
   - Updated the main README.md to include information about redundancy
   - Created a quick start guide for the redundancy implementation

## Testing

The redundancy implementation can be tested using the provided test scripts, which verify:
- The application continues to function if an application instance fails
- The application continues to function if the primary database fails
- Data persistence across server restarts

## Next Steps

1. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for all services to detect failures
2. **Automated Backups**: Set up automated backups for the database and video files
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Develop a disaster recovery plan for the application
4. **Performance Testing**: Conduct performance testing to ensure the redundant system meets performance requirements

## Conclusion

The redundancy implementation addresses the single points of failure in the original architecture and provides a more robust and fault-tolerant system. By implementing multiple application instances, database replication, and shared storage, we can ensure high availability and data durability.
