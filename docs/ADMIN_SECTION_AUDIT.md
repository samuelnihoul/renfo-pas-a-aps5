# Admin Section Audit

## Overview
This document summarizes the audit of the admin section in the application and the changes made to improve it.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Routines Card
Added a new card for Routines to the admin dashboard, reflecting the program-routine relationship implemented in the database schema. The admin section now has 4 cards:

1. **Programmes** - For managing training programs
2. **Routines** - For managing training days within programs
3. **Exercices** - For managing exercises
4. **Blocks** - For managing blocks of muscle strengthening

### 2. Updated Grid Layout
Changed the grid layout from `md:grid-cols-3` to `md:grid-cols-4` to accommodate the new card and ensure proper display on medium and larger screens.

### 3. Added Appropriate Icon
Used the `FileText` icon for the Routines card to visually differentiate it from the Programs card (which uses the `Calendar` icon).

### 4. Updated Welcome Message
Updated the welcome message in the admin section to mention all four aspects of the application (programs, routines, exercises, and blocks), making it more comprehensive and consistent with the actual content of the admin section.

## Relationship to Previous Work

This change builds upon the previous work:

1. **Block Feature Audit** - The admin section now properly reflects the block feature that was audited and improved.
2. **Program-Routine Implementation** - The admin section now includes a dedicated card for Routines, reflecting the fact that programs are divided into routines as implemented in the database schema.

## Future Improvements

While the current changes address the immediate requirements, there are additional improvements that could be made in the future:

1. Implement the actual pages for managing routines (`/admin/routines` and `/admin/routines/nouveau`).
2. Add user management functionality to the admin section.
3. Add analytics or reporting features to the admin dashboard.

## Conclusion

The admin section has been updated to reflect the program-routine relationship and now includes 4 cards as required. These changes enhance the usability and completeness of the admin interface.
